    receiving-pr-reviews skill's own workflow step 6 — from being mistaken for a response to
    whatever review happens to be newest at the time it is posted. Requiring the reference to also
    postdate the review's effective timestamp still catches an editor adding new feedback to an
    already-referenced review after the fact. One comment referencing multiple reviews' URLs
    correctly clears all of them; no review is limited to being "claimed" by only one comment. A
    review with no `submittedAt` (not yet actually submitted) is excluded rather than treated as
    always-unresponded.

            in any order.

    bound). `watch` passes its own `deadline` for each *poll*, so all seven of
    `build_fetch_result`'s `gh` calls are bounded by whatever is actually left, re-measured between
    them, rather than by a fixed reservation subtracted from every poll regardless of how fast
    GitHub responds.

    Args:
        deadline: A `time.monotonic()` timestamp to respect, or `None` for no deadline.
        gh_timeout: The caller's own per-call bound, used when there is no deadline.

    Shared by `fetch` (prints the result once, `deadline=None`) and `watch` (calls this repeatedly
    on a polling interval, passing its own deadline) so both subcommands assemble a `FetchResult`
    identically. Makes seven `gh` calls, each independently bounded by `gh_timeout_budget(deadline)`:
    the paginated review-threads query, the paginated reviews query, every PR-level issue comment
    (for `unresponded_reviews`), every reaction on the PR itself (for `codex_approved`), the
    currently-authenticated `gh` identity (also for `unresponded_reviews`), and the PR's head
    commit date plus its most recent force-push timestamp, if any (both also for `codex_approved`
    — see `_fetch_head_state` and `_fetch_latest_force_push_at`). Every one of the seven is
    a fresh snapshot taken by this call alone — nothing here is compared against an earlier call's
    result, which is what makes two `watch` calls back to back, or a `watch` call issued right
    after a `fetch`, incapable of missing or double-counting activity that happened in between (the
    failure mode a per-invocation in-memory baseline used to have).

    `unresponded_reviews` is every `reviews_with_body` entry `_unresponded_reviews` cannot find an
    explicit, postdating reference to among the currently-authenticated `gh` identity's own
    PR-level comments — see that function for why a review's own `url` must be quoted in a comment
    that postdates the review's effective timestamp (the later of `submittedAt`/`lastEditedAt`),
    rather than inferring a match purely from chronological order: an unrelated administrative
    comment that merely postdates a review (e.g. a cross-thread sequencing decision this skill's
    own workflow sanctions) is not evidence it addressed that review's feedback, and a plain
    chronological cutover cannot tell the two apart. Comments from any other account are ignored
    for the same reason a comment without any reference is. A review with no `submittedAt` (not
    yet actually submitted) is excluded rather than treated as always-unresponded.

    `codex_approved` is `True` when a "+1" reaction from exactly the Codex bot's known login (not
    merely one that starts with the same text — see `_CODEX_REACTOR_LOGINS`) exists on the PR
    itself at the moment of this call *and* that reaction's own timestamp is at or after the later
    of the PR's current head commit's date and its most recent force-push timestamp, if any — see
    `_fetch_pr_reactions`, `_fetch_head_state`, and `_fetch_latest_force_push_at`. Neither
    date alone is sufficient: a reaction left approving an earlier revision would otherwise keep
    reporting as approval indefinitely, even after a later push the reaction never actually saw,
    including a force-push that resets the branch back onto a pre-existing commit object whose own
    embedded date predates the reaction.

    Args:
        owner: Repository owner login.
        repo: Repository name.
        pr: Pull request number.
        deadline: A `time.monotonic()` timestamp the caller wants this call's seven `gh`
            invocations to respect — see `gh_timeout_budget`. `None` means no deadline.
        gh_timeout: Per-call bound applied when `deadline` is `None`; `None` means no bound.
