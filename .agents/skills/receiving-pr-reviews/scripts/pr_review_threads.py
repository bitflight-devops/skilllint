"""GitHub PR review-thread operations for the receiving-pr-reviews skill.

Wraps the `gh` command pipelines the skill documents: fetching every unresolved review thread and
unresponded review (auto-paginated, filtered before it reaches an agent's context), replying to a
review comment, and resolving a review thread. Every operation shells out to `gh` (GitHub CLI)
rather than talking to the GitHub API directly, relying on `gh`'s own authentication. A fourth
command, `watch`, blocks this process on an internal polling loop so a caller never needs a
separate resumption mechanism to re-check a PR later. A fifth, `checks`, reports whether the PR's
required CI checks have passed, and can wait on the same bounded schedule for a still-running one.

`fetch`'s and `checks`'s I/O and their `FetchResult`/`WatchResult`/`ChecksResult` assembly live in
`pr_review_gh.py`; the data contracts live in `pr_review_models.py`. This module is the CLI
presentation layer: it parses arguments, drives the polling loops, and prints results.

Usage:
    uv run pr_review_threads.py fetch --pr 3208
    uv run pr_review_threads.py watch --pr 3208
    uv run pr_review_threads.py checks --pr 3208

    no reviews have landed yet — different from a nonzero `threads_count` with `unresolved_count:
    0`, which means every thread found was already resolved. Never treat an empty `unresolved`
    array as "nothing to do" without checking these counts first. Each unresolved thread carries
    its own `id` (for resolving) and each comment's `databaseId` (for replying) — no separate
    lookup needed. A thread's `comments_truncated: true` means that single thread has passed 100
    comments in its own back-and-forth (rare, but real content is missing) — page that thread's
    `comments` connection directly before concluding anything about it.

    `reviews_with_body` is every review whose top-level summary text is non-empty (an approval
    note, or feedback given in the review body rather than as an inline comment) — these have no
    thread at all and would otherwise be invisible even when `unresolved_count` is 0.
    `unresponded_reviews` narrows that to the ones nothing has been posted on the PR about since —
    see `pr_review_gh.build_fetch_result` for exactly how that is derived; treat each as
    actionable input.

    `codex_approved` is `True` when Codex's thumbs-up reaction is present *and* postdates the
    current revision. When it is `False`, read `codex_approval_stale` before concluding anything:
    `True` there means Codex did approve but a later push replaced the code it approved, so a fresh
    review has to be requested rather than waited for. Both `False` means Codex has not reacted at
    all. `codex_approved_at` and `latest_revision_at` are the two timestamps that verdict was
    computed from.

    `reviewability.blockers` is non-empty when the PR itself is why nothing is outstanding: a draft
    gets no reviewers requested and a conflicting branch gets no review runs, so an empty
    `unresolved` array there means "nothing can happen yet", not "nothing to do". Read it before
    concluding a PR is clean. An empty `blockers` means reviews can proceed. It is about *reviews*

    Blocks this process for up to `timeout_seconds`, re-fetching every `interval_seconds`. Returns
    the moment a poll's result satisfies `state.has_outstanding_work()` — at least one unresolved
    thread, at least one unresponded review, or Codex's approval reaction — or the final state once
    `timeout_seconds` elapses with none of those ever true. If the very first fetch already has
    outstanding work, `watch` returns immediately without sleeping at all: every check here is a
    fresh `gh` snapshot, not a diff against an earlier call, so there is nothing to wait for that
    the first fetch would have missed.

    Each call covers only its own `timeout_seconds` window. To watch for longer than one call's
    default window, issue `watch` again immediately after a `timed_out: true` result — its own
    first fetch picks up exactly where the previous call's last poll left off, so consecutive calls
    never miss activity in between (nothing here depends on what an earlier call saw). The
    receiving-pr-reviews SKILL.md documents this loop pattern.

    Prints the same compact JSON `fetch` prints, nested under `state`, plus `timed_out`. Check
    `state.reviewability.blockers` on a `timed_out: true` result before issuing another call:
    waiting out another window for reviews that cannot arrive — the PR is a draft, or conflicting —
    is pure waste, and the fix is on the PR rather than in the review queue.

    `deadline` is the only cutoff. The loop polls while a full `interval_seconds` still fits before
    it and stops once less than that remains — the point past which `gh_timeout_budget` would
    starve the call to nothing anyway. No fixed safety margin is reserved: this repository has no
    source for how long seven sequential `gh api` round trips take, and inventing one would be a
    guess (CLAUDE.md, "No invented constraints"). The final sub-interval stretch of a window is
    therefore left unpolled by design — the next `watch` call's own first fetch covers it, which is
    exactly why the loop pattern above is documented as back-to-back calls.

    Exits non-zero, with nothing printed to stdout, if the *last* re-poll attempted this window
    failed (a transient `gh` failure — see the exception handling inside the loop). An earlier
    success in the same window does not offset a later failure: what matters is whether the final
    stretch before `deadline` was actually confirmed, not whether any check ever succeeded. A
    `timed_out: true` result on stdout is only ever printed when the most recent check — the first
    fetch, or the last re-poll if one was attempted — succeeded, including the case where no
    re-poll was attempted at all because the window ended too soon for one, which is an honest
    "nothing to report," not a failure. A poll cut short by `deadline` itself is that same honest
    ending rather than a failure; a non-zero `gh` exit never is — see the two handlers below.

    unsettled:

    - `pending` is proof that a check context exists on the head commit and has not finished. It
      polls for the caller's whole window — there is a real answer coming.
    - `none` is ambiguous. GitHub returns a null `statusCheckRollup` both for a head commit whose
      workflow runs it has not registered yet — the state in the seconds right after the push that
      the receiving-pr-reviews skill tells the reader to run `checks` after — and for a repository
      with no CI at all. Returning that first snapshot as final made `--timeout-seconds` a no-op
      exactly when it was needed most.

    A `none` therefore gets exactly one re-poll of grace. That bound introduces no duration of its
    own: the wait is one `--interval-seconds`, the unit the caller already chose as "how long
    between observations", and the caller's `--timeout-seconds` still caps it. One observation
    after a wait is the least that can tell the two cases apart — a registration gap has closed
    into a real verdict by then, while a repository with no CI still reports `none` and settles
    there instead of spinning out the whole window on an answer that will never change.

    checks *cannot start*, not that the repository has no CI, which is otherwise indistinguishable
    and is why a PR can appear to stall indefinitely.

    With `--timeout-seconds 0` (the default) this is a single snapshot. Given a timeout it polls,
