"""GitHub PR review-thread operations for the receiving-pr-reviews skill.

Wraps the three `gh` command pipelines the skill documents: fetching every unresolved review
thread (auto-paginated, filtered before it reaches an agent's context), replying to a review
comment, and resolving a review thread. Every operation shells out to `gh` (GitHub CLI) rather
than talking to the GitHub API directly, relying on `gh`'s own authentication. A fourth command,
`watch`, blocks this process on an internal polling loop so a caller never needs a separate
resumption mechanism to re-check a PR later.

Usage:
    uv run pr_review_threads.py fetch --pr 3208
    uv run pr_review_threads.py watch --pr 3208
    uv run pr_review_threads.py reply --pr 3208 --comment-id 123456 --body "Fixed in abc123."
    uv run pr_review_threads.py resolve --thread-id PRRT_kwDO...

    this run did not have, or the final clean state once `timeout_seconds` elapses with no new
    activity.

    Each call covers only its own `timeout_seconds` window. To watch for longer than one call's
    default window, issue `watch` again immediately after a `timed_out: true` result — its own
    baseline fetch picks up exactly where the previous call's ended, so back-to-back calls never
    miss activity between them. The receiving-pr-reviews SKILL.md documents this loop pattern.

    Prints the same compact JSON `fetch` prints, nested under `state`, plus `timed_out`,
    `new_thread_ids`, and `new_reviews_with_body`.

    before it and stops once less than that remains — the point past which `_gh_timeout_budget`

    window is therefore left unpolled by design — the next `watch` call's baseline fetch covers
    it, which is exactly why the loop pattern above is documented as back-to-back calls.

    Exits non-zero, with nothing printed to stdout, if the *last* re-poll attempted this window
    failed (a transient `gh` failure — see the exception handling inside the loop). An earlier
    success in the same window does not offset a later failure: what matters is whether the final
    stretch before `deadline` was actually confirmed, not whether any check ever succeeded. A
    `timed_out: true` result on stdout is only ever printed when the most recent check — the
    baseline fetch, or the last re-poll if one was attempted — succeeded, including the case
