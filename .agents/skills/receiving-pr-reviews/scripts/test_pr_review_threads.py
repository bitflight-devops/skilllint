"""Tests for pr_review_threads.py, pr_review_gh.py, and pr_review_models.py.

Covers: `pr_review_gh.build_fetch_result`'s multi-page flattening, resolved-thread filtering,
`comments_truncated` derivation, `reviews_with_body` filtering (including a null `author`, which a
deleted GitHub account produces), `unresponded_reviews` derivation against the currently-
authenticated `gh` identity's own PR-level comments — requiring each comment to explicitly quote a
review's own `url` and postdate its effective timestamp (the later of `submittedAt`/`lastEditedAt`)
before it counts as a response to that specific review, not merely inferred from chronological
order or excluded only by author — and `codex_approved` reaction detection scoped to reactions that
postdate the PR's current head commit — all as one JSON-in/JSON-out pipeline test plus a matrix of
focused unit tests against `build_fetch_result` directly. Also covers `FetchResult.has_outstanding_work`
(the single trigger rule `watch` polls for) and `watch`'s own loop: returning immediately when the
first fetch is already actionable, polling until it becomes actionable, timing out when it never
does, and the deadline-budget/transient-failure mechanics carried over from the pre-existing polling
loop.
