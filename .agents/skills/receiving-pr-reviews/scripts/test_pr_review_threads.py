"""Tests for pr_review_threads.py.

Covers the non-trivial logic identified in review: `_build_fetch_result`'s multi-page
flattening, resolved-thread filtering, `comments_truncated` derivation, and
`reviews_with_body` filtering (including a null `author`, which a deleted GitHub account
produces); and `watch`'s baseline-diff — both the "new activity found" and "timed out with
none" outcomes.
