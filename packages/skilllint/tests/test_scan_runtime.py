"""Tests for scan_runtime seams extracted from plugin_validator.py.

These tests verify the extracted seams are correctly implemented and
wired into the CLI path. They serve as regression coverage ensuring
future refactoring cannot silently break the seam boundaries.

Coverage:
- discover_validatable_paths: Auto-discovery of validatable files
- resolve_filter_and_expand_paths: Filter resolution and path expansion
- compute_summary: Summary statistics computation
- Seam wiring: Verify CLI imports and uses these extracted functions
