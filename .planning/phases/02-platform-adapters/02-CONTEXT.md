# Phase 2: Platform Adapters - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-03-09
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Define a `PlatformAdapter` Protocol and ship bundled adapters for Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex (initial bundled adapters; see `.claude/vendor/CLAUDE.md` for all supported platforms). Enable the validator to route file validation through the correct platform-specific schema and rule set. Introduce a shared agentskills.io rule series (AS-codes) that fires across all platforms. Windsurf and other platforms are v2 scope.

## Implementation Decisions

### Adapter Protocol design
- Use `typing.Protocol` (structural subtyping) — third-party adapters do NOT import from skilllint to be compatible
- Each adapter has a string ID (e.g., `claude_code`, `cursor`, `codex`)
- Adapter's responsibilities: provide schema for each file type, declare path patterns for auto-detection, declare applicable rule codes
- Core validator owns all rule execution — adapters are data providers, not logic owners
- Adapter exposes `applicable_rules()` returning a set of rule code prefixes or explicit codes — core filters checks accordingly
- Bundled adapters registered in `pyproject.toml` via `skilllint.adapters` entry_points group
- Third-party adapters install via the same entry_points mechanism — no core modification needed

### Rule code series
- New **AS-series** codes for agentskills.io spec violations (AS001, AS002, AS003, …)
  - AS-series fires on ANY SKILL.md regardless of platform adapter
  - Examples: AS001 = name format, AS002 = description length/quality, AS003 = directory name mismatch
- SK/PR/HK codes remain Claude Code-specific
- Each platform adapter declares which code series it activates
- This separation means third-party adapters can reference AS codes without depending on SK codes

### Shared agentskills.io validation (AS-series)
All platforms that have SKILL.md files get these checks:
- `name`: 1–64 chars, lowercase alphanumeric + hyphens, no leading/trailing/consecutive hyphens, must match parent directory name
- `description`: 1–1024 chars, non-empty, should be trigger-oriented (description quality check)
- Directory structure: `SKILL.md` required, `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/` optional
- Progressive disclosure: warn if `SKILL.md` body exceeds 500 lines (move detail to references/)
- Test case detection: identify if `eval_queries.json` or equivalent test fixtures exist alongside the skill

Reference: https://agentskills.io/specification.md — researcher should also check https://agentskills.io/skill-creation/optimizing-descriptions.md and https://agentskills.io/skill-creation/evaluating-skills.md for AS-series rule completeness

### Platform detection
- Each adapter **declares its own path patterns** (glob patterns) — not hardcoded in core
- CLI matches a file against all registered adapter patterns; all matching adapters run their checks
- `--platform` flag overrides auto-detection when ambiguous or wrong
- **Multi-adapter files**: when a file matches multiple adapters, run AS-series rules once, then each matching adapter's platform-specific checks; report violations grouped by adapter
- Layered validation model:
  - AS-series rules = cross-platform baseline (agentskills.io spec)
  - Platform-specific rules = only fire when that adapter matches the file

### Layered frontmatter reality
- Cursor reads SKILL.md files from `.claude/`, `.agents/`, and `.cursor/` directories — same file may be valid for both Claude Code and Cursor
- Cursor uses agentskills.io frontmatter fields (`name`, `description`, `license`, `metadata`, `compatibility`, `allowed-tools`) but NOT Claude Code-specific fields (e.g., plugin-specific extensions)
- Adapter declares which frontmatter fields are valid for it — fields outside AS-spec and not in adapter's declared fields produce platform-specific warnings, not AS-series errors
- Researcher should verify exact Cursor and Codex field lists from their official docs

### Claude Code adapter
- Validates: `plugin.json`, `SKILL.md` (under `.claude/`), `agents/*.md`, `commands/*.md`, `hooks.json`
- Path patterns: `.claude/**/*.md`, `plugin.json`, `hooks.json`, `agents/**/*.md`, `commands/**/*.md`
- Runs existing SK/PR/HK rule series in addition to AS-series
- Reference for Claude Code-specific validation matrix: `/home/ubuntulinuxqa2/repos/claude-plugins-official/plugins/` (skill-creator and plugin-dev plugins contain Claude Code-specific validation rules)

### Cursor adapter
- Validates: `.mdc` rule files, SKILL.md in `.cursor/` directory
- Path patterns: `**/*.mdc`, `.cursor/**/*.md`, `.agents/skills/**/*.md`
- Schema content: researcher verifies complete `.mdc` frontmatter field list from Cursor docs before planning (known fields: `description`, `globs`, `alwaysApply`)
- Runs AS-series for SKILL.md files; Cursor-specific schema checks for `.mdc` files

### Codex adapter
- Validates: SKILL.md (under `.agents/skills/`), `AGENTS.md`, `.rules` files
- Path patterns: `.agents/skills/**/*.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `**/*.rules`, `.codex/**`
- Codex skill format = agentskills.io standard (same `name`/`description` frontmatter as Claude Code) — AS-series applies
- `AGENTS.md`: plain markdown, no strict schema — check presence and non-empty content
- `.rules` files: validate known Starlark `prefix_rule()` fields (`pattern`, `decision`, `justification`, `match`, `not_match`); note format is experimental and may change
- Schema source: https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills.md, https://developers.openai.com/codex/rules.md, https://developers.openai.com/codex/multi-agent.md

### Bundled schema snapshots
- Phase 1 established `load_bundled_schema("claude_code", "v1")` pattern via `importlib.resources.files()`
- Phase 2 adds `skilllint.schemas.cursor` and `skilllint.schemas.codex` namespace packages with `v1.json` snapshots
- v1.json is a Phase 2 deliverable with real field definitions (not stubs)
- Schema update tooling is v2 scope

### Phase 2 validation depth
- Schema validation: required fields present, types correct, no unknown fields
- AS-series shared rules: name/description/structure per agentskills.io spec
- Platform-specific field validation per adapter
- NO full SK/PR rule execution for Cursor/Codex adapters in Phase 2 — that is Phase 3+
- .rules (Starlark) and agents/*.toml (Codex agent roles) validated for structure only

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact AS rule code numbering beyond AS001-AS003
- Internal adapter registry implementation detail (lazy vs eager loading)
- Error message wording for AS-series violations
- Whether adapter path patterns use fnmatch or pathlib glob semantics

</decisions>

## Existing Code Insights

### Reusable Assets
- `load_bundled_schema(platform, version)` in `skilllint/__init__.py`: accesses `skilllint.schemas.{platform}/{version}.json` via `importlib.resources.files()` — adapter can call this to load its schema
- `skilllint/schemas/claude_code/__init__.py` + `v1.json`: namespace package pattern to replicate for `cursor` and `codex`
- `skilllint/schemas/__init__.py`: top-level schemas namespace — add new platform subpackages here
- Existing validators in `plugin_validator.py`: Claude Code-specific; Phase 2 wraps these behind the Claude Code adapter

### Established Patterns
- Entry_points discovery: pattern from pyproject.toml `[project.entry-points]` — same mechanism used for CLI aliases; extend for `skilllint.adapters`
- `importlib.resources.files()`: runtime schema access pattern — no filesystem paths, works in wheel
- Namespace packages with `__init__.py` markers: established in Phase 1 for schemas

### Integration Points
- `plugin_validator.py` CLI (`app`): needs to accept `--platform` flag and route to adapter
- `conftest.py` test fixtures: existing fixture patterns for validation tests — adapter tests follow same structure
- Pre-commit hook: must pass file paths through adapter detection; `--platform` may be needed for pre-commit config

### Research Required: Skill Loading Locations Per Platform
The adapter's declared path patterns must reflect where each client actually scans for skills. This is a research task — researcher must verify from official docs:

- **Claude Code**: which directories are scanned for skills, agents, commands, hooks (user scope, project scope, plugin scope)
- **Cursor**: which directories Cursor scans for `.mdc` rule files and SKILL.md files (documented as `.cursor/`, `.claude/`, `.agents/skills/` — researcher confirms complete list and any scope hierarchy)
- **Codex**: which directories are scanned at REPO, USER, ADMIN, SYSTEM scope (documented as `$CWD/.agents/skills`, `$HOME/.agents/skills`, `/etc/codex/skills` — researcher confirms complete list)
- **agentskills.io spec**: what the open standard says about default loading locations (`/client-implementation/adding-skills-support.md`)
- **OpenCode**: global agents at `~/.config/opencode/agents/`, per-project at `.opencode/agents/`, config at `opencode.json`. Agent format is Markdown with YAML frontmatter (`description`, `mode`, `model`, `tools`, `permission`, `temperature`, `steps`, `color`) — this is NOT the agentskills.io SKILL.md format. Researcher should determine whether OpenCode also loads agentskills.io SKILL.md files or only its own agent format, and whether an OpenCode adapter is in v1 or v2 scope.
- **GitHub Copilot CLI**: Uses agentskills.io SKILL.md format directly. Loading locations: project skills at `.github/skills/` or `.claude/skills/`; personal skills at `~/.copilot/skills/` or `~/.claude/skills/`. SKILL.md frontmatter: `name` (required, lowercase+hyphens), `description` (required), `license` (optional) — matches agentskills.io spec. AS-series rules apply. Researcher should confirm complete field list and any Copilot-specific extensions beyond the base spec. Copilot CLI adapter may be v1 scope given shared format with Claude Code.
- **Gemini CLI**: Uses `GEMINI.md` for project context (not SKILL.md). Custom commands stored in `.gemini/` directory. Extensions architecture documented at `github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/docs/extensions/`. Researcher must verify: does Gemini CLI support agentskills.io SKILL.md at all, or only GEMINI.md + custom commands? Determine whether Gemini CLI adapter is v1 or v2 scope.
- **Agent Client Protocol (ACP) Registry**: `github.com/agentclientprotocol/registry` — open registry for AI agent clients. GitHub Copilot CLI supports ACP (documented in Copilot CLI docs). Researcher must determine: does ACP define a skill/agent file format relevant to skilllint, or is it purely a protocol registry? What clients are registered and do any use agentskills.io SKILL.md? This may reveal additional platforms to track.

The adapter path patterns are derived directly from these loading locations — they are not arbitrary globs. Researcher should produce a loading location matrix before planner defines adapter path pattern declarations.

### Reference Repositories
- `/home/ubuntulinuxqa2/repos/claude-plugins-official/plugins/`: official Claude Code plugins with platform-specific validation rules — use as reference for Claude Code adapter rule matrix
- `/home/ubuntulinuxqa2/repos/vercel-plugin/hooks/posttooluse-validate.mjs` + `patterns.mjs`: path pattern matching approach — adapters declaring path patterns mirrors this design

## Specific Ideas

- "Adapter is a Protocol, not ABC — third-party adapters don't need to import from skilllint"
- "AS-series codes have clear provenance: AS = agentskills.io spec, SK = Claude Code-specific"
- "Cursor reads .claude/ skills but only validates agentskills.io frontmatter — not Claude Code extensions. Same file, different validation layer depending on adapter."
- "Validate all matching adapters when file matches multiple — report grouped by adapter"
- "Researcher should read agentskills.io/specification.md, /skill-creation/optimizing-descriptions.md, /skill-creation/evaluating-skills.md, /skill-creation/using-scripts.md, /client-implementation/adding-skills-support.md for complete AS-series rule derivation"
- "Codex .rules files use Starlark — validate known prefix_rule() fields but note format is experimental"

</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

- Windsurf adapter — v2 scope (ADPT-V2-01)
- Roo Code, Amp/Sourcegraph Cody, generic agentskills.io adapters — v2 scope
- Schema update tooling (automated snapshot refresh) — v2 scope (REG-V2-01)
- Full SK/PR rule validation for Cursor/Codex files — Phase 3+
- `agents/*.toml` deep validation for Codex agent roles — not in Phase 2
- MCP server wrapping for holistic_lint.py — v2 scope (MCP-V2-01)
- agentskills.io specification updates (user noted spec may need updating) — separate task outside this phase
