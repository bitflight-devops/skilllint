# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-02)

**Core value:** An AI agent or developer who creates a plugin/skill/agent gets instant, actionable feedback — in their editor, in CI, and from the AI itself — before their work ever ships broken.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Package Structure

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 7 (Package Structure)
Plan: 2 of 3 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-03-03 — Completed 01-02 (pluginlint alias, bundled schema, 529 tests passing)

Progress: [███████░░░] 67%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 6 min
- Total execution time: 0.2 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-package-structure | 2 | 11 min | 6 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (7 min), 01-02 (4 min)
- Trend: improving

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 01-package-structure P03 | 8 | 3 tasks | 21 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Pluggable adapter architecture for platform support (pending)
- Bundled schema snapshots, not live fetch (pending)
- `skilllint` as primary CLI name with aliases `agentlint`, `pluginlint`, `skillint` (pending)
- LSP + VS Code extension rather than standalone GUI (pending)
- **01-01:** sys.path.insert block retained in plugin_validator.py — removing it breaks frontmatter_core bare-name imports in installed CLI binary; requires module rename refactor before removal
- **01-01:** 3 CLI entry points confirmed: skilllint, skillint, agentlint — all map to skilllint.plugin_validator:app
- [Phase 01-02]: pluginlint added as 4th CLI alias — all four map to skilllint.plugin_validator:app
- [Phase 01-02]: Bundled schema uses __init__.py namespace markers and importlib.resources.files() pattern for runtime access
- [Phase 01-02]: v1.json is Phase 1 placeholder; Phase 2 PlatformAdapter will override with full schemas
- [Phase 01-02]: load_bundled_schema() exported from skilllint.__init__.__all__ for direct package-level import
- [Phase 01-package-structure]: All 17 test files migrated from sys.path.insert/importlib to from skilllint.plugin_validator import X; conftest.py no longer acts as import gateway
- [Phase 01-package-structure]: mocker.patch paths updated to skilllint.plugin_validator.X across all test files using patching

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 7 (.plugin): Claude Code .plugin format and marketplace submission are less documented than PyPI/VS Code Marketplace — dedicated research pass recommended before Phase 7 planning
- Phase 4 (LSP completions): YAML frontmatter completions in Markdown files is a confirmed ecosystem gap with no established pattern — LSP-05 may need a prototype to estimate complexity
